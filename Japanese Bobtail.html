        No one knows for sure when and where the Japanese Bobtail originated, but it is believed that the
        ancestors of today’s Japanese Bobtail cats traveled from Korea and China to Japan around the beginning
        of the sixth century. They most likely were kept aboard ships to protect precious silk goods and
        documents being transported from port to port. Whether these seafaring cats had bobbed tails or not is
        not known; the origin of their bobbed tail mutation will probably never be known. It’s clear, however,
        that the breed has been bobbing around the Far East for many centuries, since early Japanese folklore
        contains numerous references to short-tailed cats. Bobtailed cats can be found in Japanese woodcut prints
        and silkscreen paintings from the Edo period (1603–1867), so they were not only well known in Japan but
        by the fifteenth century were prized for their grace and beauty, and were kept in the temples and homes
        of the Imperial Japanese families for many years. It’s safe to say the Japanese Bobtail is one of the
        oldest existing cat breeds with a history as rich with legends and folklore as the country in which it
        developed.
