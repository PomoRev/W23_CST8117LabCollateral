Lab Collateral for Algonquin IAWD students

Collateral for Lab 3:

  Contains a WORD document that is used as reference for building the website. Note that the document is a flyer 
  and will not look exactly like the webpage you are creating. It is there to give you the client's look and feel.
  Contains images for the Cat Daycare exercise. 
  Images are in a subfolder and you will need to include this subfolder in the zip file that you submit for this lab.
